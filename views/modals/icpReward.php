                <p>It will be possible to make a donation to the <span class="companyNames">LEARND</span> platform to reward learners and teachers. As well as the developers.</p>
                <p>Part of these donations will be stacked in a neuron specially dedicated to education. <br>
                    The dissolved interests will feed the platform to allow the platform to live.</p>
                <p>A micro payment system will be set up so that any user who wishes can participate in the development of LEARND. <br>
                    The micro payment will be made in Bitcoin or ICP.</p>
                <p>
                    The LEARND token will create a currency within the platform and can only be used inside the platform, i.e give LEARND token for tipping or else. <br>
                    It will be exchangeable by ICPs but cannot be resold on token exchanges platforms.

                <p>The award price will also be indexed to the price of the ICP. To avoid too much outflow of money, the certificates will have a set price. </p>
                <p>The resulting courses, modules and learning paths will be awarded proportional rewards according to the value of the certificate. <br>
                    As well as a declining compensation calculated by the number of times the certificate has been passed. </p>
                <p>There will then be a defined number of times that the certificate can be passed. <br>
                    At the end of this degression, a new certificate request will be requested from the community.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> a certificate on a given topic will have the amount of ICP to be gained of 1 ICP. <br>
                    If it has two learning paths for this certificate each will be awarded 0.5 ICP. If each course contains 2 modules, each module will be allocated 0.25 ICP. </p>
                <p>If each module contains 2 courses, each course will be allocated 0.125 ICP. <br>
                    Finally, each course with 1 complete test will be able to pay the learner 0.0625 ICP per test (provided that the learner has 100% correct answers).</p>
                <p>From the start, the number of certificates available will be given. <br>
                    Also in this example, a total of 10 ICP has been given for this certificate, there will be the possibility for 10 learners to obtain it.</p>
                <p>For the remuneration of teachers, it will be the same thing. A maximum number of ICPs will be pre-defined.</p>
                <p>Still according to the example given above, a professor who participates in the development of a certificate will be able to claim to earn 1 ICP, provided that he creates ALL the certificate. <br>
                    Otherwise, if he writes or creates an entire course including the test, he may earn 0.125ICP. </p>
                <p>In addition to this, the professor will be able to receive LEARND tokens as tips that he can convert to ICP or give to the community, or to a domain he likes to pay for future certificates.</p>
