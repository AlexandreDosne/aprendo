                <p>The <strong>community</strong> will have a central role and will be made up of users, teachers, simple visitors or even donors and savers.</p>
                <p>The community will be at the base of the development of the platform since it will be requisitioned to vote on the integration or not of a course, a module, a learning path or a certificate. <br>
                    The process is as follows:</p>
                <div class="row text-center justify-content-center">
                    <img src="assets/img/learndLifeCycle.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid p-4">
                    <a href="http://learnd/assets/img/learndLifeCycle.jpg" target="_blank" class="pb-4" title="see the picture on full size">Full size</a>
                </div>
                <p>Decisions will be made by vote and each voter will have more or less weight depending on the degree of their participation and investment in the platform.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: a user who has several NFT certificates will have more voting rights than a simple visitor. A professor who has contributed little to a certificate will have less voting rights than one who has participated a lot.
                    <br> A participatory democracy system is set up within the platform and is at the heart of its operation.
