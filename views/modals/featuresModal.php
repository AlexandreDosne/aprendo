                <p>In the future, depending on the partnerships, it will be possible to exchange its LEARND tokens or its ICP for goods or services. <br>
                    See even being able to buy / receive shopping coupons from companies that will be LEARND partners.</p>
                <p>example: A sports textile company decides to invest in education and chooses LEARND. <br>
                    The company, instead of paying for ads that ruin our lives and our screens, is paying for the creation of a sports business certificate.</p>
                <p>The money that this company spends will pay the learners and the teachers. <br>
                    But this sports textile company will have the right to offer in return, coupons or products to all those who have passed the certificate or even one or the other module. </p>
                <p>. Always in principle that there is a limited number of certificates. <br>
                    10 Certificates on business in sports offered by the partner company, with the possibility of spending its rewards on the products offered itself</p>
                <p>Imagine that with the brands you are particularly fond of ... In the fields you are passionate about ...</p>
                <p>The choice of companies will initially be made by the LEARND team. Then, thereafter, the community will be able to vote to let or not a company to be a partner of the platform.</p>
                <p>Other features will emerge, be patient!</p>
