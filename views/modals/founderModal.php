                    I strongly believe that everyone on earth has a gift that it can be share to the whole world to make it a better place.
                    I do trust in education between people, transmission of knowledge by words, art, culture and all sorts of forms. <br>
                    I hope someday LEARND will bring to thre world the decent education that every human being deserve. And not become a privilege for some. <br> <br>
                    Deep changes come when ignorance is dying. Would you help me to kill that "Ignorance" ?</p>
