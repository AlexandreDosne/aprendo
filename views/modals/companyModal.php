                <p>LEARND will be able to transform itself into a recruitment platform. <br>
                    Indeed, companies will be able to ask<span class="companyNames">LEARND</span> to create a course, a module, a learning path or an NFT certificate to certify the skills sought.</p>
                <p>Companies will also be able to use search filters to find learners who match their research.</p>
                <p>A learner will then have the opportunity to apply for positions while proving their abilities within a single platform.</p>
                <h6>Distrikt and other IC Dapps</h6>
                <p><span class="companyNames">LEARND</span>  will be able to partner with the social network on IC<span class="companyNames"> Distrikt </span>.</p>
                <p>The different Distrikts will be able to meet and test their skills on the courses, modules, learning paths or certificates that their community has created.</p>
                <p>Ultimately LEARND would like the partnership of other IC structures, such as <span class="companyNames">ToniqLabs </span> for the certification of NFTs integrated into LEARND. <br>
                </p>
                <p> The possibility of interacting with <span class="companyNames"> PORTAL </span> for streaming lessons given by the teachers. <br>
                    And many others along the road.</p>
                <p>Moderation can be done by <span class="companyNames">Modclub</span></p>
