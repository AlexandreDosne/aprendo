                <p>Anyone will be able to create their own course, module, learning path or certificate using a tool: the Community Content Creator system. <br>
                    This tool will be accessible to everyone, and will look a lot like a blog post (Medium) site.
                </p>
                <p> Each creator will be able to advertise it to obtain sufficient funds to operate his certificate (see the terms on tokenomics under “Tokenomics” below). <br>
                    A crowdfunding based on the quality, reliability, usefulness and difficulty of the content, with a limited time to obtain the funds. If funds are obtained, the content is submitted to LEARND teams for validation. If validated, the creator will be awarded a first Content Creator badge (Which could be NFT?!). <br>
                    Different badges will be available: Junior - Medium - Expert, which will allow each creator to create their E-reputation in the field they have chosen. And will be able to claim to become a teacher. </p>

                <p> In the event that the funds are not obtained, the creator will be refused the posting of its content. <br>
                     He can then turn to the community to try his luck again with their help. Together, we are stronger !!</p>
