                <p>LEARND will make partnerships with true, legit NFT projects.
                    Example: 10 NFT certificates can be obtains for learners that finished the whole thing. One by learners.
                    Every NFT claimed and given could be sold after on marketplace as <span class="companyNames">Entrepot</span>.
                </p>
                <h6 class="text-center">AND</h6>
                <p>A NFT LEARND certificate will be given to those who finished the certificate with success. </p>
                <p>Those LEARND certificate will be proof of work / knowledge / skills that can be shown to the rest of the world, especially to company that hire.</p>
                <p>Ultimately LEARND would like the partnership of other IC structures, such as <span class="companyNames">ToniqLabs </span> for the certification of NFTs integrated into LEARND. <br>
                </p>
                <p>Who will manage all this beautiful mess? <br>
                    Future LEARND employees !! </p>
