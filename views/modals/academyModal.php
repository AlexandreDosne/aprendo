                <p>The first way to create partnerships will be to call on universities or schools which will then want to put their courses, modules, learning paths or certificates online. <br>
                    They will then be able to give work to their teachers or call on the community of LEARND teachers to create their courses.</p>
                <p>The ability for learners to learn certified courses that will have greater intrinsic value will allow them to earn more tokens.</p>
                <p>The partnership with academies could be financial, strategic or simply in the order of knowledge sharing.</p>
                <p>The learners will also be able to claim a selection by these same schools, universities through <span class="companyNames">LEARND</span> .</p>
